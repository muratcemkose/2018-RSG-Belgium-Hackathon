The authors of the above article would like it to be known that the principle of Multi-netclust is incorrectly illustrated in Figure 1. The connected clusters shown in B and C do not correspond with the aggregation rules/formulae indicated below the illustrations. Swapping the clusters with one another restores this correspondence. The authors apologize for this error.
