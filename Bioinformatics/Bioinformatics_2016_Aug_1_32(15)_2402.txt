The authors wish to correct the following error in the above article: in the legend of figure 1, a sentence in the legend reads, ‘But there are two orbits in graphlet G2, as the two end nodes are topologically identical to each other but not to the middle node (and vice versa)’, this should be corrected to, ‘But there are two orbits in graphlet G1, as the two end nodes are topologically identical to each other but not to the middle node (and vice versa)’. The authors apologize for this error.
