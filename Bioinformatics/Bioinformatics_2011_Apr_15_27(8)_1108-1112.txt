1 INTRODUCTION
Systems biology is applied to study the components of, and more importantly their
complex interactions in, biological systems. One set of components which are studied
in systems biology investigations are metabolites, either by targeted or holistic
profiling experimental strategies (Dunn et
al., 2011). Low molecular weight inorganic and organic
metabolites play important roles in the operation and maintenance of biological
systems. The study of metabolites (metabolomics) is increasingly being applied to
investigate microbial (Bradley et
al., 2009; MacKenzie
et al., 2008; Mashego et al., 2007), plant (Allwood et al., 2008; Fernie and Schauer, 2009; Hall
et al., 2008), environmental (Bundy et al., 2009; Viant et al., 2006) and mammalian (Griffin,
2008; Kenny et al., 2010;
Lewis et al., 2008)
systems. Many studies follow a hypothesis generating or inductive strategy (Kell and Oliver, 2004) and start from a small
and known subset of biological knowledge. Valid experiments are designed to acquire
robust and reproducible data on a wide range of different metabolites and metabolite
classes from carefully selected samples. Subsequent data analysis procedures define
the metabolic differences associated with a biological change related to genotype,
biological perturbation or environmental intervention (for example, drug therapy).
These studies employ a metabolic profiling strategy to detect a wide range of (but
not all) metabolites from numerous biochemical classes to obtain maximum metabolic
information rapidly. This strategy provides the detection of hundreds or thousands
of metabolites. However, due to the diverse range of chemical and physical
properties and the wide concentration range of metabolites within the metabolome, no
single analytical technology can provide the non-biased quantitative detection of
all metabolites in a biological system (Dunn,
2008). Metabolic profiling provides semi-quantitative data, typically as
chromatographic peak areas, rather than absolute quantitation where metabolite
concentrations would be reported. Mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR) have been widely employed and provide complementary
roles (Dunn et al., 2005,
2011). Chromatography-MS techniques
provide advantages for these highly complex biological samples and include gas
chromatography (GC-MS), liquid chromatography (LC-MS) and LC derivatives including
ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-MS). Capillary Electrophoresis-MS
(Soga et al., 2003) and
LC-MS apply electrospray ionization. Direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) can
also be applied, though lacks the chromatographic separation of metabolites (Dunn et al., 2005; Southam et al., 2007).
Hyphenated platforms can provide (with suitable operation and mass calibration) high
separation resolution, high mass resolution and mass accuracy, typical limits of
detection of micromol per litre and the ability to identify metabolites through a
combination of Retention Time (RT)/index, accurate mass and gas-phase
fragmentation-derived mass spectra. Each of these platforms, whether hyphenated or
non-hyphenated, provide different advantages and disadvantages for metabolite
identification as has been reviewed previously (Dunn
et al., 2011). The increasing use of high mass
resolution LC-MS and UPLC-MS platforms provides the detection of many thousands of
features [see Brown et al.
(2009) for a comparison of the features detected related to sample type]
with high mass accuracy and has led to a need to develop data handling methods for
the conversion of this raw analytical data into biological knowledge.

One of the data processing procedures essential in metabolic profiling is metabolite
identification which has been reviewed previously (Dunn et al., 2011; Wishart, 2009). Guidelines have been provided by the Metabolomics
Standards Initiative to define how the different levels of metabolite identification
can be reported (Sumner et al.,
2007). A range of approaches can be applied for metabolite
identification. Two generalized types of identification are achievable: putative
identification and definitive identification.

Putative identification usually employs one or more molecular properties for
identification, but does not compare these to the same properties of an authentic
chemical standard as is performed for definitive identification. The accurate mass
(or m/z) of an analyte and its associated
isotopologues can be used to define molecular formulae (MFs) from which suitable
metabolites can be derived by searching a range of electronic resources [e.g.
PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/), KEGG
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
and MMD (Brown et al., 2009)]
and has been previously shown (Brown et
al., 2005; Junot et
al., 2010; Lane et
al., 2008; Rogers et
al., 2009). Direct matching of accurate mass (or
m/z) to data in electronic resources
without intermediate matching to MF can also be performed. However, structural
isomers and stereoisomers have the same accurate mass and therefore require a
separate, orthogonal property for identification of all potential isomers.
Typically, this is chromatographic separation though separation of isomers is not
always achievable. Separation of enantiomers requires a chiral chromatography
column.

Definitive identification employs at least two properties (typically RT or index and
fragmentation mass spectrum) and compares these properties to an authentic chemical
standard analysed under identical analytical conditions. In LC-MS and UPLC-MS
applications, the accurate masses of the detected ions is employed in combination
with other rules (e.g. isotope ratio of 12C and 13C isotopic
peaks to define the number of carbon atoms present in the MF; calculated as peak
area 13C isotopologue/peak area 12C isotopologue) to
generate MF and thus provide putative metabolite identification(s). Specific rules
are not always applicable. For example, 13C/12C isotopic
peaks can only be applied on instruments where accurate isotopic ratios are detected
and where 13C-artificially labelled metabolites have not been applied in
the biological experiment. Fragmentation mass spectra (MS/MS or
MSn) are then used to provide increased
confidence through comparison to authentic chemical standards or to in
silico-derived fragmentation mass spectra to give an unequivocal
metabolite identification (Wolf et
al., 2010). It should be noted that not all authentic
chemical standards are commercially available and that MS/MS and
MSn fragmentation mass spectra are not always
accurate in unequivocal identification of two isomeric metabolites.

Studies by the authors have assessed the level of complexity of electrospray UPLC-MS
data derived from biological extracts in a metabolic profiling strategy (Brown et al., 2009). This work
has shown that a multitude of different ion types are observed including commonly
described ions (e.g. protonated, deprotonated, sodium or potassium adducts and
13C isotope). However, many other unexpected types of ions including
adducts (e.g. complex combinations of sodium chloride and formate dependant on the
matrix type and mobile phase), fragments, dimers, multiply charged and instrument
specific ions (e.g. Fourier Transform (FT) artifact peaks) are also detected. Each
different ion type is defined as a feature, whose accurate mass (or
m/z) is unique but whose RT and
chromatographic peak profiles are identical. Information on the type of ion should
be applied in metabolite identification (Brown
et al., 2009; Draper
et al., 2009).

Automated software or workflows for high-throughput identification of large
metabolomic datasets are not freely available. Currently, metabolite identification
is a manual or semi-automated process assessing those features of biological
interest and not the complete set of detected features (Dunn, 2008). For metabolomics to be successful it is essential
to derive biological knowledge from analytical data, a view emphasized by a recent
Metabolomics ASMS Workshop Survey 2009 which found that the biggest bottlenecks in
metabolomics were thought to be identification of metabolites and assigning of
biological interest (http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics-Survey-2009).

To fill the gap in requirements, three workflows have been written to perform for the
first time integrated, automated and high-throughput annotation and putative
metabolite identification of electrospray LC-MS and UPLC-MS metabolomic datasets in
a freely available package. The workflows were developed in the Taverna Workflow
Management System to provide flexibility in their operation and the ability to
rapidly and simply integrate with web services and other Taverna workflows in the
future [for example, see Li et al.
(2008)], so as to provide integrated data analysis and bioinformatics or
cheminformatics packages. Examples are available on myExperiment, a repository of
workflows freely available to the scientific community (http://www.myexperiment.org/), including a workflow to perform data
pre-processing with XCMS and a workflow to perform in silico
fragmentation applying MetFrag. The achievement of this level of integration would
be more technically demanding and would require significantly greater expertise and
time if coded in many other programming languages. Taverna is also easy to operate
for relative novices with minimal training as the process involves defining
parameter values and files only.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION
The current lack of freely available workflows or software to process deconvoluted
data acquired from electrospray LC-MS experiments led the authors to develop three
workflows. The workflows have been developed in Taverna (Hull et al., 2006) using Beanshell, a Java
scripting language, which is enabled in Taverna and can perform data manipulation,
parsing and formatting. Taverna can be downloaded from http://www.taverna.org.uk. The
workflows were developed under Windows using Taverna v1.7.0 and subsequently tested
using Taverna Workbench 2.2.0. In combination, the workflows perform the automated,
high-throughput annotation and putative metabolite identification of electrospray
LC-MS and UPLC-MS metabolomic datasets. The software has been coded as a series of
separate workflows to allow more flexibility in the analysis of data by obviating
the need to re-run the whole pipeline when altering one of the workflow parameters,
such as the mass tolerance or database. This approach also reduces the likelihood of
memory problems when handling large datasets on computers with small RAM.

The workflows, related files and standard operating procedure (SOP) are available to
the user community on http://www.mcisb.org/resources/putmedid.html and will also be placed
on MyExperiment (http://www.myexperiment.org/). In general, the input and output
files are tab-delimited (*.txt) files and are sorted by ascending accurate mass
or MF as appropriate (ordered as C, H, N, O, P, S, Br, Cl, F, Si in ascending
alphanumeric form as is standard for PubChem). Internal checks are made within the
workflows to ensure that the number of features in both peak and data files match
(workflow for correlation analysis) and that the study and reference input files are
sorted either by accurate m/z (workflow for
metabolic feature annotation) or MF (workflow for metabolite annotation).
Termination of the process and reporting of an informative error message occurs if
this is not the case. The three workflows are described in detail in the available
SOP and briefly below.

2.1 Workflow for correlation analysis
The workflow for correlation analysis (List_CorrData) allows the user to
calculate either Pearson or Spearman rank correlations or read in previously
calculated correlation data. The correlation calculations allow for NaN, Inf and
0 in the input data and are equivalent to using the Matlab (http://www.mathworks.co.uk/) corr function with the following
parameters: corr(Xdata, ‘rows’, ‘pairwise’,
‘type’, ‘Pearson’) or corr(Xdata,
‘rows’, ‘pairwise’, ‘type’,
‘Spearman’)



2.2 Workflow for metabolic feature annotation
The workflow for metabolic feature annotation (annotate_MassMatch) uses
correlation coefficient information calculated in the workflow for correlation
analysis, accurate m/z difference, RT and
median peak area data to group together and annotate features with the type of
ion (isotope, adduct, dimer, others) originating from the same metabolite. The
same metabolite can be detected as different ion types each with different
m/z. Following annotation, the
experimentally determined accurate m/z are
matched to the accurate m/z of unique MF
in a reference file within a specified m/z
tolerance.

2.3 Workflow for metabolite annotation
In the workflow for metabolite annotation (matchMMF_MF), the MF from the output
file calculated in the workflow for metabolic feature annotation is matched to
the MF from the Reference file of metabolites (trimMMD_sortMF.txt or other
appropriate reference file). The metabolite information for all matched MFs is
added to the input data and output data are generated in three formats, each of
which can be saved as tab-delimited files by the user.

3 RESULTS
An assessment has been made of the workflows' ability to perform putative
metabolite identification using two reference files: (i) a listing of unique
accurate mass/MF data from PubChem using specific elements (C, H, N, O, P, S,
Br, Cl, F, Si only; file downloaded from http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/projects/Seven_Golden_Rules/) selected
to give a wider selection of MFs and (ii) The Manchester Metabolomics Database
(Brown et al., 2009)
constructed with data from genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, HMDB, KEGG,
LIPIDMAPS, BioCyc and DrugBank. Data from all these sources are included to provide
a comprehensive set of metabolites. For example, HMDB does not contain all lipids
that are theoretically present in human biofluids and tissues and therefore
inclusion of data from LIPIDMAPS provides greater complementary metabolite
coverage.

A clinical dataset of fasting blood serum samples were taken from participants
according to ethical guidelines and stored before being analysed with quality
control samples in a random order and within 48 h of reconstitution using an UPLC
(Waters UPLC Acquity, Elstree, UK) coupled on-line to an electrospray LTQ-Orbitrap
hybrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The collection
and storage of serum samples and the UPLC and mass spectrometer methods applied have
been previously described (Dunn et
al., 2008; Zelena et
al., 2009). Independent samples (118 in total) were analysed
in both positive and negative ion mode. Raw data files (.RAW) were converted to the
NetCDF format using the File converter program in XCalibur (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Bremen, Germany). Deconvolution of data was performed using XCMS, running on R
version 2.6.0, an open-source deconvolution program available for LC-MS data (Smith et al., 2006) using
identical settings to those reported previously (Dunn
et al., 2008). This produced a list of features with
associated RT, accurate m/z and
chromatographic peak area. For these data, the mass accuracy was assessed using a
set of 35 and 50 metabolites commonly detected in serum and plasma in positive and
negative ion modes, respectively. Shown in Table
1 is the distribution of annotated features found in the dataset and
excluded from further mass matching. Table
1. Distribution of annotated peaks in negative and
positive ion mode

Features summary	Negative ion mode	Positive ion mode	
No. of features	2173	4348	
No. of correlations (>0.7, RT ± 5 s)	11 867	50 867	
Invalid RT (40 s < RT > 1200 s)	224	487	
FT artifact peaks	61	66	
Isotopes (13C, 34S, 37Cl)	455	1170	
Multiply charged ions	22	444	
Salt ions (not adducted to metabolites)	40	31	
Total no. of excluded features	802 (36.9%)	2198 (50.6%)	
No. of features remaining for identification	1371 (63.1% of all detected features)	2150 (49.4% of all detected features)	


In positive ion mode >50% of features were marked for exclusion from
further metabolite identification, which was considerably higher than in negative
ion mode (36.9%) due in part to the much greater occurrence of multiply
charged ions (∼10% of all features). It should be noted that multiply
charged ions can be peptides, proteins or high molecular weight metabolites capable
of carrying multiple charges. Approximately 25% of these excluded features
are isotopic peaks. These are annotated and linked to the related molecular ion. In
the workflow for metabolite annotation, all isotope and FT artifact peaks are
labelled with the accurate identification observed for the molecular or adduct
ions.

Using a mass tolerance of 3 p.p.m., ∼6% of the remaining features were not
matched to any unique MFs in the PubChem reference file (301507 entries).
Seventy-six percent in negative and 60% in positive ion mode of the remaining
features (791 and 1292 features) were fully annotated and given putative metabolite
identification using a revised version of the MMD database (31648 entries). The
reference data file is based on molecules and parent compounds carrying no charge
and is derived from the MMD which contains an array of information from a wide
variety of electronic resources. The MMD data file was revised by removal (or
modification) of charged species of salts e.g. sodium ascorbate, calcium citrate,
metamphetamine hydrochloride. Obvious duplicates of data were removed and for many
common metabolites e.g. amino acids and sugars only a single stereochemical form of
the compound was retained. The included form usually related to the one most well
described in HMDB, and if not present in HMDB then as described in KEGG, and if not
present in HMDB and KEGG then as described in LIPIDMAPS and resulted in a much
cleaner dataset for putative metabolite identification. A fairly stringent mass
tolerance of 3 p.p.m. was used in this analysis and in a number of cases the
annotation of adducts is based on strong evidence, but the exact mass matching may
be outside the allowed tolerance. This is certainly seen for metabolites such as
tryptophan where many ions/adducts are detected, some of which are within the 3
p.p.m. mass tolerance and others, particularly K and NaCl/HCOONa adducts of low
response, are in the mass error range of 3–10 p.p.m. Increasing the mass
tolerance would result in more of these adducts being correctly matched but would
greatly increase the overall number of putative metabolite identifications through
matching to a greater number of MFs. This is possible if further data are acquired
to reduce the number of potential hits (e.g. 13C/12C
isotope ratios or MS/MS fragmentation). Additionally, neither reference file had
‘complete’ information relevant to the human metabolome—the MMD is
from a wide variety of sources and includes drugs (but not drug metabolites), and
the PubChem reference file contains a limited number of elements and limited numbers
of atoms per element.

The workflow for correlation analysis processed correlation data in 3–20 min
depending on the option selected and the number of features. The workflow for
metabolic feature annotation processed the negative ion data in ∼3 min for the
PubChem reference file. In positive ion mode with 100% more peaks and nearly
5 times as many correlations, the processing time was <20 min. The number of
correlations is the rate determining factor and in most cases processing is <30
min and frequently <5 min. The workflow for metabolite annotation matched MF
derived from experimental data to MF in MMD rapidly when fewer than 5000 matches
were present. This process took just over 1 min to perform in each ion mode.
However, when using large reference files such as PubChem, typically up to 30 000
matches, processing time may be of the order of 1 h.

The workflows developed are automated, rapid, open-source and freely available with
all features fully annotated or given putative metabolite identifications. The
approach is flexible, it is independent of chromatographic deconvolution method and
analytical instrument applied. Additional adducts can be added to the adducts file
for user-specific instruments, and data and organism-specific metabolite reference
files can be used. Two additional differently formatted outputs are available for
all matched features and the workflows have the potential to be integrated with
other Taverna workflows.

Large numbers of features are recognized as artifact, isotope, salt and multiply
charged ions and removed from the metabolite identification process. This in
combination with data with good mass accuracy (in raw data or following
post-acquisition mass alignment) results in a greatly reduced number of putative
metabolite identifications within a specified mass tolerance (typically 3 p.p.m. for
the ThermoFisher Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap acquired data). Using this approach,
putative metabolite identification does not depend on a high level of experience in
dealing with MS data and can be used as a starting point for subsequent definitive
identification.

A number of false positives are always found although they are significantly reduced
using this approach by annotation of ion type prior to assignment of accurate
m/z to MF or metabolite. Wide variation in
m/z or RT range or missing values
following deconvolution can result in any or all of the following: (i) mass
difference can be outside mass tolerance limits (e.g. missed adduct); (ii) RT
difference between two features may be outside given value (missed grouping); and
(iii) correlation between two features may be below specified limit (missed adduct,
missed grouping). Within the software, allowance is made for this, for example, a
feature (sodium adduct) that has a correlation with the parent metabolite below the
correlation limit will not be grouped with this feature. However, if the
m/z is within the mass tolerance it will
still be putatively identified as the appropriate sodiated ion. Additional grouping
information based on correlation is present in the output file and can assist the
user when two or more MFs matches are reported for a feature.

4 CONCLUSIONS
The workflows presented are rapid and high-throughput and greatly reduce the number
of false positives by eliminating the inaccurate matching of many artifact, isotope
and complex adduct peaks. Subsequent definitive identification employing at least
two properties of sample-derived metabolite and an authentic chemical standard
(typically RT and fragmentation mass spectrum) can then be performed. Additional
information based on similarity measures (e.g. metabolite class or metabolite
pathway) are being incorporated into the Manchester Metabolomics Database and will
allow in time for further interrogation of the biological changes of interest within
microbial, plant and mammalian metabolomic studies. Further developments are planned
to amalgamate the separate workflows together and to integrate with separate
workflows to increase the applicability and ease of data analysis and
interpretation.
