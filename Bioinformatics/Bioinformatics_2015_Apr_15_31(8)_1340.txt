In the above paper, there were several mistakes due to copyediting error. In Theorem 1 ‘if’ should be replaced by ‘iff’ and should read as follows: For odd k, an RC complete sequence s achieves the lower bound (Proposition 1) iff there exist two edge-disjoint paths with no repeating edges, corresponding to s and RC(s), that together cover all edges of the de Bruijn graph of order k − 1.

In Algorithm 1 ‘although’ should be replaced by ‘while’, and should read as follows:

1. Initially all edges are unmarked, F=R=∅,

 and A={u}, an arbitrary vertex.

2. While A≠∅ do

3.  F=R=∅.

4.   Pick any starting vertex v=[x1,…,xk−1] from A.

5.   While there exists an unmarked edge e=(x1,…,xk)

   outgoing from v do

6.    Append e to F. Prepend RC(e) to R.

7.    Mark e and RC(e).

8.    Set v=[x2,…,xk]; A=A∪{v}.

9.   Remove v from A.

10.   If F≠∅, add F to F; add R to R;

11. Merge the cycles in F to obtain a single forward path.

  Do the same for R.
