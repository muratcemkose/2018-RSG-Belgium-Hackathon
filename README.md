We have participated and won RSG Belgium Hackathon 2018. Our project  was "Generating an AI bioinformatics paper".
The goal of this project is to build a framework that can generate a bioinformatics paper.
We managed to write a script generating main elements of an article (randomly). We used an HMM and trained the model with existing sample 
papers. Training is done for each section and each section is generated separately adding a sense of consistency to the paper. In addition, we added random figure and table in case these elements are refered in the paper. All output is in latex format. With some small changes, we provided "Sample_result_Oxford_Bioinformatics_Journal.pdf" as an example.
The project had to be complited in 8 hours.
